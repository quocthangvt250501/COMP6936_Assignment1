This is the repository for Assignment 1 of the COMP 6936 - Advanced Machine Learning course. Guidance to run the code:
1. Clone this Git repo.
2. Upload to Google Collab or any Jupyter notebook with Python support kernel which can run this notebook well.
3. Change the path in the os.chdir command to your current working directory, or remove it.
4. Choose to run all of the notebook, or you can choose to run each part that you need to reproduce. For convenience, we have already plotted and printed out all the results.
